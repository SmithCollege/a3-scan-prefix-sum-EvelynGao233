This homework is much harder than the previous one. 

It took me a lot of time to determine what was going on for each algorithm and why their performance was different. 

What went well was that I worked with my friends to figure out what we were trying to do and compare our results to confirm. 

This homework could also serve to show how GPU works faster than CPU in dealing with this kind of question. 

Also, I didn't include the last two columns of data for naive GPU because it took a much longer time.
