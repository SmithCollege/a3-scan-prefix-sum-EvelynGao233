Did your graph match your runtime analysis expectations?
So it matches what I expect that recursive doubling will become the fastest one as array size increases. Also, it proves that GPU runs faster because of its parallel design. 
Even if I optimize the time complexity of CPU to O(N), GPU still runs faster for extremely large size array.

What went well with this assignment?
What went well was that I worked with my friends to figure out what we were trying to do and compare our results to confirm. 
This homework could serve really well to show how GPU works faster than CPU in dealing with this kind of question. 

What was difficult?
This homework is much harder than the previous one. 
It took me a lot of time to determine what was going on for each algorithm and why their performance was different. 

How would you approach it differently?
Maybe I will work with my friends together first. Because when we spent a lot of time checking.

Anything else you want me to know?
I didn't include the last two columns of data for naive GPU because it took a much longer time.
